# llm-code-highlighter

**llm-code-highlighter** is a TypeScript library for creating succinct repository highlights, based on Paul Gauthier's repomap technique as outlined in the [Aider Chat docs](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html) and implemented by the code in the [aider](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider) and [grep-ast](https://github.com/paul-gauthier/grep-ast) repos.

This typescript version of the original python code was created with assistance from ChatGPT 4. Every line of code was manually curated by me (@restlessronin) ðŸ˜‡.

## Installation

At the moment, this plugin is only being actively developed against the [Continue repository](https://github.com/continuedev/continue). If you are interested in other use cases, please [file an issue on the repository](https://github.com/restlessronin/llm-code-highlighter/issues) and I'll see what I can do to accommodate.
